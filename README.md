# Sprite Mover
A tool that helps animators to test their sprite sheets in motion.

Sprite Mover is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

You can set:
- Frame Count
- Frame Width (px)
- Frame Height (px)

Sprite Mover tells you the what are the expected dimensions for your sheet. 
For example if you have a 24 frame sheet, with the size of 150x150 per frame, the expected sprite sheet dimensions are 3600px (width) * 150px (height).

You can import the sprite sheet by browsing or drag & dropping onto the page.

You can play/pause the animation and adjust it's speed.

## Here's how you can deploy it:

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and enjoy!
